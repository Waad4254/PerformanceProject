Notes: 

1. Object Pooling Part (in project Rubric)
It's already been implemented in the starterProject so I don't know if there is 
something else I'm supposed to do.

2. If you run the project and the lighting effects didn't show up
just turn it off then run it again. I tried looking into this issue but I still don't 
know the cause yet. If you've got an idea please share it with me, I would like to know.


Thanks,
